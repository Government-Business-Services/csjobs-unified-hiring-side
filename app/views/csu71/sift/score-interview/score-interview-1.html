          <!-- 6 mins	Experience questions
          Building engaging and effective relationships with stakeholders

Understand the strategic drivers for your area of work. Align activities to contribute to wider organisational priorities. Remain alert to emerging issues and trends which might impact your work area. Seek out and share experiences to develop knowledge of the teamâ€™s business area. Understand how the strategies and activities of the team create value and meet the diverse needs of all stakeholders.

"Work with others to identify areas for improvement and simplify processes to use fewer resources. Use technology where possible to increase efficiency. Encourage ideas for change from a wide range of sources. Clearly explain the reasons for change to colleagues and how to implement them, supporting individuals with different needs to adapt to change. Encourage an environment where colleagues know that they can challenge decisions and issues safely. Take managed risks by fully considering the varied impacts changes could have on the diverse range of end users."


Can you tell me about your experience of building a trusted advisor-style relationship with a stakeholder? Can you give me examples of how you were able to achieve this?

Can you describe a time when you have received a reaction to a piece of work or project that you weren't expecting? How did you manage the situation?
