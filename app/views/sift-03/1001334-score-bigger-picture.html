      <p class="govuk-body-m">When it came to tackling the issue at hand, I knew that seeing the big picture was my secret weapon. I’ve always had a knack for zooming out and taking in the landscape. This allowed me to identify the root cause that was fuelling problems, and then I collaborated with the right people to make my vision come to life.<BR><BR>

      It was a thrilling experience that made a real impact when it was needed.<BR><BR>

      Before I could rally my team to contribute to the solution, I had to get to the bottom of what was driving the policy. It was crucial for me to understand the main drivers so that I could align our activities with the department’s priorities. It was like putting together a puzzle, and once I had all the pieces, I could create a clear roadmap for my team to follow. It was a challenge, but I was determined to make it work.<BR><BR>

      I had to inspire my team to persevere with a challenging objective, empowering them to take ownership of their work. I ensured that each member of my team felt valued and appreciated, instilling in them a sense of pride and ownership in their work. Through my leadership, every individual was encouraged to reach their full potential and contribute to the collective success of the team.<BR><BR>

      In the end, my effort paid off, and I made a significant impact on the policy success and outcomes for the communities affected by government decisions.</p>
